          This past spring I was working as a SWE intern at Dreambound, a
          startup based in San Francisco that pairs job-seekers with training
          programs to help them find employment.

          I'm currently a 3rd year CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations
          in intelligence and info internetworks. Some of my academic interests
          include full-stack web development, computer networking, and high
          performance computing.

          At Georgia Tech I'm involved in the GT Student Foundation investments
          committee, The Agency, GT Student Developer Club, and the competitive
          programming team.
