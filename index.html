      <h1>Hey, my name's Jack.</h1>
      <h2>

      <p>
        I'm currently a sophomore CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in 
        intelligence and info internetworks. Some of my academic interests include 
        machine learning, quantitative finance, NLP, and competitive programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Georgia Tech I'm involved in the GT Student Foundation investments 
        committee, The Agency, GT Student Developer Club, and the competitive 
        programming team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm interning at the Georgia Tech Foundation where I'm working on
        applying NLP and deep learning techniques to financial sentiment analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my interests outside of academics include weightlifting, stock trading, 
        jazz drumming, chess, and golf.
